# Autism Bill USA

Survival Analysis for the Approval of a Autism related Bill in each USA State.

## Objective

This project aims to provide a survival analysis on what variables and how long does it take for a specific autism related bill to be approved on USA states.


## Justification

Autism Spectre Disorder (ASD) is a multi-diverse neurodevelopmental disorder that usually starts during childhood and persists during adolescence and adulthood. On most cases, the condition begins to be apparent on the first five years of life, which can lead to difficulties in socialization and communication, as well as tendencies in repetitive and restricted patterns.

A study conducted in the United States detected a spike in TEA diagnostics through out the country recently, which caused state governors to act on it with new state policies, providing help and care to TEA individuals. However, the US currently has 50 states, all of which are vastly different in many regards, causing them to react differently to this situation.


With all this in mind, political science professor Denilson (IPOL/REL-UnB) reached out to our statistics professor Juliana Fachini (CIC/EST-UnB), asking for help to analyze the data regarding a specific autism related bill. As an expert in Survival Analysis, professor Fachini suggested this project to our group, sharing her knowledge and guiding us in this task.


## Choices and Metodology

Our dataset was provided by both professors, and we were free to shape it as we please. There was'nt much necessity in data cleaning, aside from removing missing values. However, we did a lot of data transformation, from creating new variables, data categorization, adjusting the dataset to work on the different types of plots we used, and much more.

All of the statistical theory regarding survival analysis techniques we used is present on the "Relatorio\_Final-Grupo6.Rmd" file. Note that this file is capable of generating a PDF file through the use of RStudio's RMarkdown, making the project much more readable. Just make sure to have all related files in the same folder as the .Rmd, and change user specific values within the code, such as the working directory.
